# Fyle Assignment 
This project aims to create a website for calculating taxes based on user input. Users can input their gross annual income, extra income, age group, and total applicable deductions to calculate their tax liability.

## Functionalities:
1. Takes input for Income, Extra Income, Age group and Deductions. Doesn't restrict users from entering incorrect values in number fields.
2. Highlight error icons to the right of input fields when incorrect values are entered, with tooltips displaying the error message on hovering.
3. Age dropdown should have options for <40, ≥ 40 & < 60, and ≥ 60. If not selected, show an error icon indicating it's required over hovering.
4. Error icons are not be visible by default.
5. Upon submission, a modal should display the final calculated tax values with a close button that resets the form.
